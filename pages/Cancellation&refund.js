        <h2>Cancellation and Refund</h2>
        <p>
        You have the right to cancel your subscription or request a refund for products or services purchased on our website, subject to the following terms and conditions. To initiate a cancellation or refund request, you must contact our customer support team within a specified timeframe, typically within [X] days from the date of purchase or initiation of the subscription. In the case of subscriptions, if you cancel within this specified timeframe, we will cease charging your payment method, and your subscription will be terminated at the end of the current billing cycle. Please note that any fees or charges incurred prior to the cancellation date will not be refunded. If you are dissatisfied with a product or service and are eligible for a refund, we may require you to provide a detailed explanation of the reasons for your dissatisfaction. Refund eligibility may vary depending on the specific product or service and may be subject to our sole discretion. We reserve the right to refuse refunds if we determine, at our discretion, that the request is not valid or that the product or service has been adequately provided. In cases where a refund is approved, we will process the refund within a reasonable timeframe and using the original payment method, unless otherwise specified. Please note that the timing of the refund reaching your account may vary depending on external factors, such as banking processes. We are not responsible for any fees, charges, or currency conversion rates applied by your bank or payment provider. Additionally, refunds will be issued in the original currency of the purchase unless otherwise explicitly stated. We reserve the right to modify or update our cancellation and refund policies at any time, and any changes will be communicated to you through the website or other appropriate means. It is your responsibility to review and understand the cancellation and refund policies before making any purchases or subscribing to our services. </p>
